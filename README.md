# Malware Detection in R

## Overview
This project aims to develop predictive models for detecting malware vulnerabilities in machines using data provided by Kaggle. The analysis follows the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology.

## Objectives
The primary goal is to predict the vulnerability of a machine to malware attacks based on key characteristics. The target variable is binary, indicating the presence or absence of detections.

## Data
- **Source**: Kaggle competition dataset
- **Size**: Over 8000 records, with 83 variables
- **Sample Used**: First 800 records for initial analysis

## Methodology
The project employs several machine learning models to identify the best-performing approach for malware detection:
- Neural Networks
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Bagging
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Ensemble Methods

## Data Preparation
- **Variable Types**: Variables were correctly typed as factors or strings based on initial analysis.
- **Missing Values**: Analyzed and handled missing data, with strategies including deletion of rows/columns with excessive missing values and imputation using mean/mode.
- **Feature Engineering**: Generated dummy variables for categorical features.

## Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using cross-validation, with logistic regression emerging as the top performer based on accuracy and AUC metrics.

## Usage
To run the project:
1. Install necessary R packages.
2. Load the dataset and scripts.
3. Execute the main script to preprocess data and train models.

## Results
Logistic regression provided the best results, with an accuracy of 66%. Ensemble methods were tested but did not significantly outperform logistic regression.
